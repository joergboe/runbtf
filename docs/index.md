# runbtf

The runbtf Bash based framework for the test of any kind of UNIX commands or the test of software written in Bash.
The test cases are formulated as bash commands and are structured in collections and suites. The framework supports the
creation of variants of the test cases and suites and thus facilitates the achievement of a high test coverage.
Parallel execution is supported to speed up the tests. The framework provides HTML files for convenient evaluation
of the test results in the browser.
